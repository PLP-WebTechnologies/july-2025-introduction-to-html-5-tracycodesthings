            <h2>So What Exactly is Ibuprofen?</h2>
            <p>Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatiory drug (NSAID for short) commonly used to relieve pain,
                reduce inflammation and lower fever. It is available over the counter and is used in many countries including
                ours.

            <h2>How Does it Work?</h2>
            <p>Good question! The drug works by blocking the production of prostaglandins (heck of a name i know) which are chemicals
                in the body that promote inflammation,pain and fever. It does this by inhibiting the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX) 
                which is involved in the production of prostaglandins. Dont mind the big words theyre just there to make me sound smartðŸ˜…</p>
